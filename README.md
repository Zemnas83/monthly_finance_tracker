# monthly_finance_tracker
This was the final project for the class INST326 (Object Oriented Programming for Infomration Science). The purpose of this project is for users to be able to visualize their monthly incomes, budgets and expenses. 
The project utilizes a variety of Python concepts I learned from the class such as inheritance, reading and writing to a file, using data analysis and visualization modules and many other concepts.
